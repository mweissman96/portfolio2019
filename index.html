        <div class="cell small-12 medium-12 large-12">
          <p>My name is Matthew Weissman, an up-and-coming game, level, and web designer. From my first design steps drawing Mario levels as a four-year-old, my skills have developed considerably, especially in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Consequently, the majority of the projects under my belt no longer meet my quality standards. As a result, I've structured this portfolio more around problem-solving and critical thinking than around game and level design, using my newer
            but less numerous 3D projects.</p>
          <p>As I continue to complete projects moving forward, the focus of this portfolio will shift toward the projects themselves rather than individual problems I solved during them.</p>

        <div class="cell small-12 medium-5 large-5">
          <p>Matthew Weissman is a game and level designer who has been working at his craft for over 10 years.  He is mostly self-taught, and also pursues other related interests such as programming and music composition.  He is inspired by the majestic, colorful worlds of Spyro the Dragon, as well as the mechanical complexity and rich lore of Star Wars: The Old Republic.</p>

          <p>His work primarily focuses on light, vibrant color, and non-solid materials.  He enjoys exploring the gap between fantasy and realism, and between science fiction and realism.  His efforts are focused in Unreal Engine 4.  In his current project, unnamed as of yet, he is laying the groundwork for a full-fledged, AAA-scope game.  He currently resides in San Ramon, where he recently moved after getting married over the summer.</p>
